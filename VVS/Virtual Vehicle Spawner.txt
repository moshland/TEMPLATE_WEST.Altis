Virtual Vehicle Spawner (VVS) is what the title says, it is like Virtual Ammobox System (VAS) but for vehicles. This comes with limited
configurability but will be expanded later in time. The only real good use this has is for Armory missions, if you use it for something else then cool!

Installation:
Same deal with VAS. You need to place the following in your description.ext:

#include "VVS\menu.h"

If you already have the class CfgFunctions in your description.ext then just place inside the {} for class CfgFunctions:

#include "VVS\Functions.h"

If you do not have class Cfgfunctions already in your description.ext then:

class CfgFunctions
{
	#include "VVS\Functions.h"
};

Now for the actual configuring part (using the map editor) there are two things required, a object or man to attach the addaction to and a marker. So first
place your 'vehicle vendor' guy down on the map and near him put a marker down and name it. Remember what you named the marker. Now on the 'vehicle vendor' guy
put the following into his initialization field:

this addAction["Virtual Vehicle Spawner",VVS_fnc_openVVS,["VVS_all_1","All"]];

Now here is what we look at: ["VVS_all_1","All"]
This array is our vendor configuration. 

VVS_all_1: this is our marker name where the vehicle will spawn
All: This is our filter for what type of vendor he is. All means he shows all vehicles. Filters that work:

All
Car
Air
Ship
Submarine (This is SDV's, will later be merged into Ship).
Armored

It is recommended that you open the example mission in the editor and see how I set everything up. Another thing to note is whichever direction you have the marker facing
it is the direction the vehicle will face when it spawns in. I would like to give a more detailed / easily setup guide but I've been up for a long time..
