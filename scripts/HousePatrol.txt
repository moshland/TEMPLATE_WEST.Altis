		Random House Patrol Script v2.2 for Arma 3 
		    by Tophe of Östgöta Ops [OOPS]

=================================================================
This script will allow you to have a unit patrol a house, randomly.

All you need to do is to run the script on a unit and place it close to a building. 
The script will then check how many available positions there are in the closest building, 
place the unit randomly at one and have it patrol the building. 

Every time the unit reaches it's waypoint inside the house it will stay and wait for a short 
while before moving to the next point. The amount of time the uniy waits is random. 
So you'll never really know how long the unit will stand still.

If you turn on the debug mode, all positions will be marked with ingame 3d markers.
Also there is a chat feedback from the units, as well as a map marker showing the next waypoint.

It works in Multiplayer as well as Singleplayer.

HOW TO USE:

Place unit close to a house and set init field to:  guard = [this] execVM "HousePatrol.sqf" 
 

OPTIONAL SETTINGS:

guard = [this, MODE, STAND TIME, EXCLUDED POS, STARTING POS, DEBUG] execVM "HousePatrol.sqf" 


* BEHAVIOUR - set unit behaviour.
	guard = [this,"COMBAT"] execVM "HousePatrol.sqf" 
	
	Options: CARELESS, SAFE, AWARE, COMBAT, STEALTH
	Default: SAFE

* STAND TIME - Set maximum amount of seconds the unit will wait before moving to next waypoint.
	guard = [this,"SAFE",50] execVM "HousePatrol.sqf" 
	
	Options: Any value in seconds. 0 = continuous patrol.
	Default: 30

* EXCLUDED POSITIONS - exclude certain building positions from patrol route.
	guard = [this,"SAFE",30, [5,4]] execVM "HousePatrol.sqf" 
	
	Options: Array of building positions
	Default: [] (no excluded positions)
	
* STARTING POS - Some building positions doesn't work well will the setPos command. 
	Here you may add a custom starting pos. Negative number means starting pos will be randomized.
	guard = [this,"SAFE",30, [5,4], 2] execVM "HousePatrol.sqf" 

	Options: Any available building position
	Default: -1 (random)
	
* STANCE - Tell the unit what stance to use.
	To keep the unit from going prone you can set this to MIDDLE or UP.
	AUTO will be the standard behaviour and unit will crawl around in combat mode.
	HIGH is the default mode. This is like AUTO but prone position is excluded.
	
	Options: UP, DOWN, MIDDLE, AUTO, HIGH
	Default: HIGH
	
* DEBUG - Use markers and chatlog for mission design debugging.
	guard = [this,"SAFE",30, [], -1, true] execVM "HousePatrol.sqf" 	
	
	Options: true/false
	Default: false


DEFAULT SETTINGS: guard = [this, "SAFE", 30, [], false] execVM "HousePatrol.sqf"

- Added a workaround for a game bug where some buildings are missing data.

KNOWN ISSUES:

Sometimes Arma has some problems with pathfinding and getting units to 
report if they have finished or failed a task. To get around any such
problems the guard will be given a new command if it takes more than 30
seconds to finish the last command. Some houses seem to be more difficult
for the AI to sort out.
